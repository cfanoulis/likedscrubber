_Clearing your library on Spotify was never easier_

Likedscrubber helps give your Spotify Library a fresh new start, by placing your already-existing songs in "Liked Songs" in an archive playlist, then promptly clearing out your Liked Songs. Gone are the days of clicking 279 times to clear out a library.

## Install

Grab your flavor on the [releases](https://github.com/cfanoulis/likedscrubber/releases) page, as well as a copy of `.env.example`. Place them side by side, fill out `.env.example` and then just run the executable! By the power of Rust, it should be done in mere seconds!
